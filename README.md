# GitOps Use Cases

Collection of GitOps use cases to use with [SonataFlow Operator](https://sonataflow.org/serverlessworkflow/latest/cloud/operator/install-serverless-operator.html).

## Simple CI Build with Tekton and Kaniko

In this example, we show the possibility to build a "single file" SonataFlow project into an image. Later, this image can be used to deploy the workflow with the SonataFlow operator.

See [here for more details](ci/tekton//simple-build-kaniko/README.md).
